This reflection comes before I actually finished Assignment 3, but still, I have come somewhere halfway to finish it.In the beginning, it was very frustrating because I didn't even know where to start. The consultation with the professor was helpful, so now I connected the pages, and created the shopping cart, at least.I feel that even we spent a lot of time on cookies and sessions, the whole process wasn't really clear for me, it still isn't completely clear, so I have to fiddle with it before figuring it out. Also, I have no idea how to send the email, but I will save that for the end, as it comes at the end. The assignment is huge and requires a lot of time spent on it, especially since I took the harder route, and I had to design all these different pages, then figure out what to do about it.Dealing with it is what I imagine being bipolar may look like. At first a huge down and willlessness and a sense of incapability, and after the consultation, I started figuring out how to do things and I felt really good about it and smart and proud, and now it's getting down again when I get stuck again, etc.
Anyway, I think this class was very useful for me and I am happy I took time and effort to go through it, as I did ponder on dropping it and taking the easy way out. 
Mahalo for all of your efforts,Stasha
