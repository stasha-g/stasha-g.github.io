My Ph.D. project is about creating a network visualization tool to help Ph.D. students get information that will help them obtain the degree. More often than not, this information resides within the community and not online, so an important aspect of this application is a visualization of social networks and knowledge networks.
My intention is to create a tool that can be reusable in other domains. To show that this project is an awesome idea, I need a prototype, that I may or (probably) may not program myself- and to do that I need to be aware of the tricks of the trade. Therefore, I enrolled in this class, to get a full picture of what web applications programming encompasses, and to gain some hands-on Javascript skills.
